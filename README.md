# todo: create a readme for FAC 14 week 2 project

## Hey, what's going on here?

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by. Team IJKL has returned for its difficult second album, and has been making an all-new project - a totes interactive todo app made with neat bits of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

We wanted to help disorganised people do the following:

- Enter tasks they need to do into a webpage
- Mark tasks as complete
- Edit, delete and sort todos
- Also: **testing** (for us, not the users)

With all that in mind we got the band back to together for one last show before embarking on our solo careers/week 3 group reshuffle.

## That sounds super nifty!

IT SURE DOES. That's why we called our todo app **nifty**.

## Did you have a design process or was this all an accident?

Please, we live for a good process.

### Day 1

- We began by brainstorming our ideas and spending a large chunk of time reading through the pre-existing code we inherited as we began our journey to comprehension.
- We then split into two pairs and began coding up our JavaScript logic file - this included things like adding, delete and marking functions. We started with a TDD approach but, if we're being completely honest, kind of lost our focus on testing as we advanced through the end of the day and into day 2.
- By the end of Day 1 we had our logic pretty much complete and ready to roll. Our code was probably not the most beautiful in the world but we felt like proud parents _because it was all ours_.

### Day 2

- On day two we split into two groups - one took over styling and aesthetics and our other pair got stuck into all the Javascript.
- Our aesthetic pair got absolutely stuck into the CSS, paying special attention to our spacing elements (our design challenge for the week) and creating a mobile-first design and intuitive visual elements.
- Our unaesthetic pair had a blast squashing some bugs, refactoring code and incorporating some stretch goals - such as adding an 'are you sure?' message before deleting (design heuristics alllllllll up in here) and the ability to edit entries.

On reflection we perhaps siloed ourselves a bit much on Day 2 - both groups were totally into their respective tasks, and it might have been better to swap up our programming pairs a little more. But we were in frequent communication with one another so we never felt like we were losing sight of the overall code base.

## Who do I blame for this terrible readme?

- Emma (aka baby spice)
- Eve (aka posh spice)
- Jessie (aka sporty spice)
- Martin (aka ginger spice)

and finally...

- GitHub (aka scary spice)
